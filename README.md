# rawdrawandroid-VS
  
it's almost rawdrawandroid but with some innovations
  
this is an adaptation of my code that I wrote in the month of May without any such edits (the code does not look very good), but in comparison with rawdrawandroid, I have loading images from assets and the root folder of the application  
  
what is needed to build in Visual Studio, I advise you to read the documentation from here: https://github.com/Kronka/miniapp
